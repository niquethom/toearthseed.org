    Hi, I am Dominique and I am the steward of this portal. I am an Afrofuturist organizer, busy-body trainer, scientist and artist. I view climate justice as integral to liberation. I would say my biggest joy is centered in Black liberation to create the material conditions for communities to build power with one another through principled practice and strategize to dismantle systems of oppression. <a href="mailto:nique.thom@gmail.com">Hit me up!</a>
