    For this section, things that still need to be done
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I need to review all the survey responses and begin to analyze them</li>
    <li>I need to record some of the responses </li>
    <li>I need to pull out the key themes </li>
  </ul>

    Organizing is a transformational process through which participants gain the skills and expertise they need to build the power necessary to win the changes they seek. It is built on relationships, trust, leadership development and developing our political analysis. The only way to do this is by understanding the current time and conditions. <b>What is the current time Harlem is experiencing?</b>

    Alondra Nelson says: “Afrofuturism is a critical perspective that opens up inquiry into the many overlaps between technoculture and black diasporic histories. Afrofuturism looks across popular culture…to find models of expression that transform spaces of alienation into novel forms of creative potential. In the process it reclaims theorizing about the future.”  Afrofuturism provides us with a framework to think outside of redlining, structural racism and environmental racism offers to us and the power of political imagination.  Afrofuturism is a cultural and organizing lens that is used to think about the types of the future. Specifically it aims for people to vision into a future where systems of oppression can be dismantled. For Harlem residents, it can be a powerful tool because it is unapologetic about situating Black people at the center of futures.

    In parable of the Sower, the main protagonist Olamina and the rest of the world are dealing with climate disasters, political strife, war, censorship and amongst all of this a multiracial cross-class group is able to build power, trust, values and principles with one another through the teachings of Earthseed to create their own community that is completely outside and separate from the state.

    (ASK): What are other examples of socio-political movements that push back against racialized capitalism, similar to Afrofuturism?
  </p>

    Harlem is a complex place with dynamic and complex individuals. It has been a space known to experience rich cultural growth and progress at the same time while balancing racist policies that have divested from the people. <b>What does the future hold for the community of Harlem and how do we ensure that future is thriving?</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Many current and past Harlem residents during the Fall of 2022 engaged in either a survey or interview process to talk about climate justice, abolition, Afrofuturism and visioning. All of these concepts are interconnected and the aim of this was to start a dialogue with people around what they are visioning for the future and to begin the process of doing an oral history project. This is to create a time capsule of the lessons and sankofas of 2022 and how we can use our collective lived experiences to create and organizing tradition towards our collective vision.

  <p>
    Let’s take a journey through our portal to minds and visions of those thinking about our futures
  </p>


  <h3>[Insert Oral History here]</h3>

  <p>
    For this section I am thinking about the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maybe a map of Harlem and when you hover over different locations audio will pop up with some images of how I am interpreting the different futures people mentioned. </li>
    <li>This map will slowly transform to show the borders of Harlem changing and spreading </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <b>future are you trying to bring into fruition? Who is present in your future? What do you need to do now to facilitate this vision?</b>
  </p>

  <p>
