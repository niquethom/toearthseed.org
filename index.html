      In this portal, time is not linear. We are experiencing the past, present and future at the same time. Do you feel it all around you?
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is a part of the inaugural <a href="https://lnkd.in/e7C6bX6J">Climate Justice Design Fellowship</a> Harvard’s Institute of Qualitative Social Science. My project is located in Harlem and explores the experiences of Black Harlem residents through an intersectional lens of climate, abolition and Afrofuturism. This project explores the lived experience of Black people living in Harlem, how they engage with their natural environment and physical space and what visions they have for the future. From these visions, we hope to begin to build out an oral and organizing orientation to build power and take sustained action in climate. My work combines Black Feminist Ecological and Afrofuturist praxis to consider what climate reparation may look like in Harlem and how these praxes can help build the necessary community power to win a climate future grounded in abolition.

      Come join me on a journey through Pathways to Earthseed, a labor of love for Black Harlemites.

      Harlem is historically and currently predominately Black. It has been a site of cultural organizing, Black liberation and the Black experience. There was a huge influx of Black people setting up roots in Harlem beginning in the late 1800s as Black Americans traveled up from the South. This was to escape the terrorism of <a href="https://www.hamptonthink.org/read/racial-justice-is-climate-justice-racial-capitalism-and-the-fossil-economy">Jim Crow along with in search for new economic opportunities</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      [INSERT XX IMAGE]
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlem has always been a point of connection and inspiration for those across the African Diaspora. It has been a link and chain to other Black spaces that were rich with Black life. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKaegbtcE00">The Harlem Renaissance</a> was a Black artistic movement that developed Harlem as a “Black Mecca”. It was a rich cultural period of time spanning the early 1900s through the 1930’s that explored political empowerment and exploration of the Black identity.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “I believe that the [African American’s] advantages and opportunities are greater in Harlem than in any other place in the country, and that Harlem will become the intellectual, the cultural and the financial center for Negroes of the United States and will exert a vital influence upon all Negro peoples.”
      <cite>—James Weldon Johnson, “Harlem: The Culture Capital,” 1925</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It was a movement that <a href="https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/2021/02/black-harlem-the-african-american-design-nexuss-harlem-storymap-traces-the-neighborhoods-black-designed-places/">highlighted the experiences of Black people such as women, immigrants and LGBTQIA+ people</a>. Although in Harlem, it was a national movement that had connections to international Black Diasporic cultural spaces and communities. Harlem has always been a point of connection and inspiration for those across the African Diaspora. It has been a link and chain to other Black spaces that were rich with Black life. Harlem has always been a point of connection and inspiration for those across the African Diaspora. It has been a link and chain to other Black spaces where people engaged in the development of a new Black identity and consciousness.

      Albeit these wonderful things, Harlem has also been a site of structural racism, white supremacy, environmental racism and gentrification. White policymakers wanted conspire to limit the economical and social progress of Harlem. There were many strategies and tactics they used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america">Redlining</a> is the practice of withholding services to potential customers who live in neighborhoods that have been classified as “hazardous” to investment. Because many of these communities have historically been Black and other people of color, these communities were severely divested from when it came to economic vitality. Combined with the lasting effects of slavery and Jim Crow, many Black people had no generational wealth and those that did were terroized and murdered. There was no process to make a people whole. To make matters worse, <a href="https://seas.umich.edu/news/redlining-and-environmental-racism">environmental racism boomed</a> using areas deemed as “hazardous” to build the industrial sector which is responsible for negative health impacts.
    </p>

    <h3>Harlem 1940</h3>
    <div class="map" id="harlem1940"></div>
    <p>
      Figure XX. <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=13/40.815/-73.953">In this map you can see Harlem during the 1940</a>. The majority of the neighborhood was deemed hazardous. You can also see that the population at the time was roughly 16% Black.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the flip side, since the early 2000s Harlem has been experiencing a sharp decline in its Black population during gentrification. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-popILAspTD16C3QTq-EHsgwIdJ4SW7Z6ZSKsTCedC4/edit#gid=0">Gentrification</a> is the process where lower income people are pushed out of a neighborhood and replaced by wealthier people due to the neighborhood being “invested in and revitalized”. In Harlem, Black people are being pushed out by the extremely high rent and replaced by white people.

    <h3>Pathways to Earthseed Walking Tour</h3>

    <h4>1) Introduction </h4>

    <h5>Guidance</h5>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Pathways to Earthseed audio walking tour. Join Dominique as she takes you on a journey through the complexities of Harlem. When you wish to continue to the next stop, locate North River Wastewater treatment plant on the google map and/or on the printable PDF.
    </p>

    <h5>Transcript</h5>

    <p>
      Hey! My name is Dominique. I am a community organizer and Afrofurist. I love being able to connect with my physical environment and nature. Walking for me is a time to connect to the past, present and future. It gives us the time to interrogate our surroundings and think about our impact on our community.
    </p>
    <p>
      This walk will take you through Harlem and will explore the past, what we see in the present and what we can imagine for the future. As you embark on this tour, I want you to think about how climate change has changed the physical space of Harlem and what will be required for Harlem to persist in spite of the climate crisis. We will be exploring topics of structural racism, gentrification, Afrofuturism and abolition. We will analyze what are the intersections of this work and how we can use visioning to develop a fluid model of power in this community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlem is a space of rich history and deep cultural relevance. This tour was created as an offering of care for Harlemnites. In the realm of Afrofuturism, time is not linear, but cyclical. Think about what it means to have no beginning and no ending. There will be a total of XX stops on this tour. All of which are located in Harlem. With all that in mind, time to go through the many Pathways to Earthseed.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h4>
      STOP #1: North River Wastewater Treatment Plant (Hudson River Greenway, New York, NY 10031
    <h4>
    <p>
      The first stop was the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant and Riverbank State Park. To continue to the next stop on the tour, locate Mother Clara Hale Bus Depot (721 Malcolm X Blvd, New York, NY 10039) on this Google map or this printable PDF map.
    </p>

    <h5>Transcript</h5>
    <p>
      The North River Wastewater Treatment Plant is located in Harlem smack dab in a park. If you walk, bike or cycle past this plant you will smell a pungent smell of rotting eggs. This is the noxious sulfur. Unsurprisingly, the plant was planned to be constructed along the Hudson near 72nd street in a predominantly white neighborhood. This community said no and the project was later moved to Harlem, a predominantly Black neighborhood.  WeACT was founded as a result of community organizing and struggle to highlight and mitigate the effects of environmental injustice and health disparities due to places like the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riverbank State Park is one of my favorite places in Harlem. I love it so much because it’s one of the places I feel closest to nature. Seeing people enjoying the outdoors, whether that is having a cookout on Juneteenth or running laps around the track, this is community. In the midst of all this beauty, nature enthusiasts are accosted with the emissions pumping into the air tainting any experience we hope to have. A park and a wastewater plant in the same place, what sense does that mean? How does it feel to be in this space? What do you see? What do you notice? Does this feel like an example of environmental racism? What activities do you or would you like to do here?

      As you walk around Harlem on the famous 145th, right before crossing the bridge to the Bronx, you will find one of many bus depots in Harlem. They are loud, they are dirty, emitting pollutants into the air causing road pollution. Every day the residents of Harlem breathe this harmful air in, not only from the buses, but from both major highways located on either side of Harlem. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed to deal with impacts of the climate crisis. However, there is a missed opportunity for investment in mass surface public transportation. If there were to be these direct investments, it would create an avenue to “accelerate electrification of public transit and improve transportation access specifically for underserved communities.” What do you see? What do you notice? What other examples of environmental injustice do you see in Harlem?

      The row of houses line the street between W 138th and W139th. This is a historical landmark. During the Harlem Renaissance, it was where a number of Black artists, intellectuals. I imagine people coming and going, creating and debating and building pieces of the “new Black identity” of the time. What songs, writings or art come to mind when being in this space? How is it distinct from other parts of Harlem?

      Although Abyssyian has been in existence since the early 1800s it has not always been located in Harlem. If you follow it’s journey in Manhattan to its current location, you will recognize it has slowly migrated north in step with the growth and movement of Black populations in Harlem. It was a fixture during the Harlem Renaissance and continues to be a space for Black culture, organizing and community. What does this church bring to the community?

      Lafayette Theater was a space of Black performance and was one of the first theaters to desegregate in New York. It was a cultural bubble and a space that jump started many actors careers. It closed its doors in 1951 and was demolished in 2013. What has replaced the theater? What does it feel like to be in a space that once housed immense talent?

      This needs no introduction. The Apollo is world famous for not only being a site of rich Black culture, but also a space where so many people performed on stage and rubbed the “Good Luck Stump” for good luck. I attended Amateur Night in 2022 with my mama who was visiting for her birthday and I felt so poured into laughing and clapping celebrating all the talent. Close your eyes and stand outside of the Apollo, what do you feel?

      Central Harlem has the largest rate of asthma in adults. A study found that air pollution was correlated with asthma in children. Air pollution is usually the result of air pollutants due to environmental racism, industrialization etc. These are grave health impacts due to climate impacts. I often think about what these types of health impacts do to people. As an asthma sufferer myself, I carry my inhaler everywhere I go.  What other health impacts are Harlemites dealing with? What would climate justice look like in this area?

      At the end of our tour is East Harlem, also known as El Barrio. This neighborhood is also one of the hottest areas in Harlem. Heat in New York is not distributed equally, which is often based on income, race and access to certain types of housing. Increased heat in this neighborhood leads to a number of health complications, such as vulnerability to illnesses. The high heat index further increases death in the elderly and young. What can be done to reduce heat in this community?

      For this section, things that still need to be done
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I need to review all the survey responses and begin to analyze them</li>
      <li>I need to record some of the responses </li>
      <li>I need to pull out the key themes </li>

      Organizing is a transformational process through which participants gain the skills and expertise they need to build the power necessary to win the changes they seek. It is built on relationships, trust, leadership development and developing our political analysis. The only way to do this is by understanding the current time and conditions. <b>What is the current time Harlem is experiencing?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Alondra Nelson says: “Afrofuturism is a critical perspective that opens up inquiry into the many overlaps between technoculture and black diasporic histories. Afrofuturism looks across popular culture…to find models of expression that transform spaces of alienation into novel forms of creative potential. In the process it reclaims theorizing about the future.”  Afrofuturism provides us with a framework to think outside of redlining, structural racism and environmental racism offers to us and the power of political imagination.  Afrofuturism is a cultural and organizing lens that is used to think about the types of the future. Specifically it aims for people to vision into a future where systems of oppression can be dismantled. For Harlem residents, it can be a powerful tool because it is unapologetic about situating Black people at the center of futures.

      In parable of the Sower, the main protagonist Olamina and the rest of the world are dealing with climate disasters, political strife, war, censorship and amongst all of this a multiracial cross-class group is able to build power, trust, values and principles with one another through the teachings of Earthseed to create their own community that is completely outside and separate from the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ASK): What are other examples of socio-political movements that push back against racialized capitalism, similar to Afrofuturism?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlem is a complex place with dynamic and complex individuals. It has been a space known to experience rich cultural growth and progress at the same time while balancing racist policies that have divested from the people. <b>What does the future hold for the community of Harlem and how do we ensure that future is thriving?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Many current and past Harlem residents during the Fall of 2022 engaged in either a survey or interview process to talk about climate justice, abolition, Afrofuturism and visioning. All of these concepts are interconnected and the aim of this was to start a dialogue with people around what they are visioning for the future and to begin the process of doing an oral history project. This is to create a time capsule of the lessons and sankofas of 2022 and how we can use our collective lived experiences to create and organizing tradition towards our collective vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s take a journey through our portal to minds and visions of those thinking about our futures
    </p>


    <h3>[Insert Oral History here]</h3>

    <p>
      For this section I am thinking about the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maybe a map of Harlem and when you hover over different locations audio will pop up with some images of how I am interpreting the different futures people mentioned. </li>
      <li>This map will slowly transform to show the borders of Harlem changing and spreading </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>future are you trying to bring into fruition? Who is present in your future? What do you need to do now to facilitate this vision?</b>
    </p>
