      In this portal, time is not linear. We are experiencing the past, present and future at the same time. Do you feel it all around you?
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is a part of the inaugural <a href="https://lnkd.in/e7C6bX6J">Climate Justice Design Fellowship</a> Harvard’s Institute of Qualitative Social Science. My project is located in Harlem and explores the experiences of Black Harlem residents through an intersectional lens of climate, abolition and Afrofuturism. This project explores the lived experience of Black people living in Harlem, how they engage with their natural environment and physical space and what visions they have for the future. From these visions, we hope to begin to build out an oral and organizing orientation to build power and take sustained action in climate. My work combines Black Feminist Ecological and Afrofuturist praxis to consider what climate reparation may look like in Harlem and how these praxes can help build the necessary community power to win a climate future grounded in abolition.

      Come join me on a journey through Pathways to Earthseed, a labor of love for Black Harlemites.

    <p>
      Pathways to earthseed is imaginary, speculative and rooted in the visions of many. It is a portal that connects you to the past, present and future at the same time.

      Hi, I am Dominique and I am the steward of this portal. I am an Afrofuturist organizer, busy-body trainer, scientist and artist. I view climate justice as integral to liberation. I would say my biggest joy is centered in Black liberation to create the material conditions for communities to build power with one another through principled practice and strategize to dismantle systems of oppression. <a href="mailto:nique.thom@gmail.com">Hit me up!</a>

      Sankofa comes from the Akan people of Ghana and is a guiding post for us to understand our past so we can move through our present and future. It sees time as nonlinear and that our ancestors are with us presently to teach us lessons.

      What lessons is Harlem showing us? What do we have to learn?

      Harlem is historically and currently predominately Black. It has been a site of cultural organizing, Black liberation and the Black experience. There was a huge influx of Black people setting up roots in Harlem beginning in the late 1800s as Black Americans traveled up from the South. This was to escape the terrorism of <a href="https://www.hamptonthink.org/read/racial-justice-is-climate-justice-racial-capitalism-and-the-fossil-economy">Jim Crow along with in search for new economic opportunities</a>.

      Harlem has always been a point of connection and inspiration for those across the African Diaspora. It has been a link and chain to other Black spaces that were rich with Black life. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKaegbtcE00">The Harlem Renaissance</a> was a Black artistic movement that developed Harlem as a “Black Mecca”. It was a rich cultural period of time spanning the early 1900s through the 1930’s that explored political empowerment and exploration of the Black identity.

    <blockquote>
      “I believe that the [African American’s] advantages and opportunities are greater in Harlem than in any other place in the country, and that Harlem will become the intellectual, the cultural and the financial center for Negroes of the United States and will exert a vital influence upon all Negro peoples.”
      <cite>—James Weldon Johnson, “Harlem: The Culture Capital,” 1925</cite>

      It was a movement that <a href="https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/2021/02/black-harlem-the-african-american-design-nexuss-harlem-storymap-traces-the-neighborhoods-black-designed-places/">highlighted the experiences of Black people such as women, immigrants and LGBTQIA+ people</a>. Although in Harlem, it was a national movement that had connections to international Black Diasporic cultural spaces and communities. Harlem has always been a point of connection and inspiration for those across the African Diaspora. It has been a link and chain to other Black spaces that were rich with Black life. Harlem has always been a point of connection and inspiration for those across the African Diaspora. It has been a link and chain to other Black spaces where people engaged in the development of a new Black identity and consciousness.
