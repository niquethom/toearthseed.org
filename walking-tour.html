  <h3>Pathways to Earthseed Walking Tour</h3>

  <h4>1) Introduction </h4>

  <h5>Guidance</h5>
  <p>
    Welcome to the Pathways to Earthseed audio walking tour. Join Dominique as she takes you on a journey through the complexities of Harlem. When you wish to continue to the next stop, locate North River Wastewater treatment plant on the google map and/or on the printable PDF.
  </p>

  <h5>Transcript</h5>

  <p>
    Hey! My name is Dominique. I am a community organizer and Afrofurist. I love being able to connect with my physical environment and nature. Walking for me is a time to connect to the past, present and future. It gives us the time to interrogate our surroundings and think about our impact on our community.
  </p>
  <p>
    This walk will take you through Harlem and will explore the past, what we see in the present and what we can imagine for the future. As you embark on this tour, I want you to think about how climate change has changed the physical space of Harlem and what will be required for Harlem to persist in spite of the climate crisis. We will be exploring topics of structural racism, gentrification, Afrofuturism and abolition. We will analyze what are the intersections of this work and how we can use visioning to develop a fluid model of power in this community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Harlem is a space of rich history and deep cultural relevance. This tour was created as an offering of care for Harlemnites. In the realm of Afrofuturism, time is not linear, but cyclical. Think about what it means to have no beginning and no ending. There will be a total of XX stops on this tour. All of which are located in Harlem. With all that in mind, time to go through the many Pathways to Earthseed.
  </p>
  <p>

  <h4>
    STOP #1: North River Wastewater Treatment Plant (Hudson River Greenway, New York, NY 10031
  <h4>

  <h5>Transcript</h5>
  <p>
    The North River Wastewater Treatment Plant is located in Harlem smack dab in a park. If you walk, bike or cycle past this plant you will smell a pungent smell of rotting eggs. This is the noxious sulfur. Unsurprisingly, the plant was planned to be constructed along the Hudson near 72nd street in a predominantly white neighborhood. This community said no and the project was later moved to Harlem, a predominantly Black neighborhood.  WeACT was founded as a result of community organizing and struggle to highlight and mitigate the effects of environmental injustice and health disparities due to places like the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant.
  </p>
  <p>
    Riverbank State Park is one of my favorite places in Harlem. I love it so much because it’s one of the places I feel closest to nature. Seeing people enjoying the outdoors, whether that is having a cookout on Juneteenth or running laps around the track, this is community. In the midst of all this beauty, nature enthusiasts are accosted with the emissions pumping into the air tainting any experience we hope to have. A park and a wastewater plant in the same place, what sense does that mean? How does it feel to be in this space? What do you see? What do you notice? Does this feel like an example of environmental racism? What activities do you or would you like to do here?
  </p>
  The first stop was the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant and Riverbank State Park. To continue to the next stop on the tour, locate Mother Clara Hale Bus Depot (721 Malcolm X Blvd, New York, NY 10039) on this Google map or this printable PDF map.


  <h4>
    STOP #2: Mother Clara Hale Bus Depot (721 Malcolm X Blvd, New York, NY 10039)
  </h4>

  <h5>Transcript</h5>
  <p>
    As you walk around Harlem on the famous 145th, right before crossing the bridge to the Bronx, you will find one of many bus depots in Harlem. They are loud, they are dirty, emitting pollutants into the air causing road pollution. Every day the residents of Harlem breathe this harmful air in, not only from the buses, but from both major highways located on either side of Harlem. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed to deal with impacts of the climate crisis. However, there is a missed opportunity for investment in mass surface public transportation. If there were to be these direct investments, it would create an avenue to “accelerate electrification of public transit and improve transportation access specifically for underserved communities.” What do you see? What do you notice? What other examples of environmental injustice do you see in Harlem?
  </p>
    The second stop was the Mother Hale Bus Depot. To continue to the next stop on the tour, locate Striver’s Row (W 138th and W 139th Street, New York, NY 10030) on this Google map or this printable PDF map.
  </p>

  <h4>
    STOP #3: Striver’s Row (W 138th and W 139th Street, New York, NY 10030)
  </h4>

  <h5>Transcript</h5>
  <p>
    The row of houses line the street between W 138th and W139th. This is a historical landmark. During the Harlem Renaissance, it was where a number of Black artists, intellectuals. I imagine people coming and going, creating and debating and building pieces of the “new Black identity” of the time. What songs, writings or art come to mind when being in this space? How is it distinct from other parts of Harlem?
  </p>
    The third stop is Striver’s Row. To continue to the next stop on the tour, locate The Abyssinian Baptist Church (132 W 138th St, New York, NY 10030) on this Google map or this printable PDF map.
  </p>

  <h4>
    STOP #4 Abyssinian Baptist Church (132 W 138th St, New York, NY 10030)
  </h4>

  <h5>Transcript</h5>
  <p>
    Although Abyssyian has been in existence since the early 1800s it has not always been located in Harlem. If you follow it’s journey in Manhattan to its current location, you will recognize it has slowly migrated north in step with the growth and movement of Black populations in Harlem. It was a fixture during the Harlem Renaissance and continues to be a space for Black culture, organizing and community. What does this church bring to the community?
  </p>
    The fourth stop is Abyssinian Baptist Church. To continue to the next stop on the tour, locate Lafayette Theater (Corner of W 132nd and Malcolm X Blvd.) on this Google map or this printable PDF map.

  <h4>
    Lafayette Theater (Corner of W 132nd and Malcolm X Blvd.)
  </h4>
  <h5>Transcript</h5>
  <p>
    Lafayette Theater was a space of Black performance and was one of the first theaters to desegregate in New York. It was a cultural bubble and a space that jump started many actors careers. It closed its doors in 1951 and was demolished in 2013. What has replaced the theater? What does it feel like to be in a space that once housed immense talent?
  </p>
    The fifth stop is Lafayette Theater. To continue to the next stop on the tour, locate Apollo Theater (253 W 125th St, New York, NY 10027) on this Google map or this printable PDF map.

  </p>
  <h5>Transcript</h5>
  <p>
    This needs no introduction. The Apollo is world famous for not only being a site of rich Black culture, but also a space where so many people performed on stage and rubbed the “Good Luck Stump” for good luck. I attended Amateur Night in 2022 with my mama who was visiting for her birthday and I felt so poured into laughing and clapping celebrating all the talent. Close your eyes and stand outside of the Apollo, what do you feel?

  </h4>
  <h5>Transcript</h5>
  <p>
    Walk down 125th and look at all the buildings. What do you see? When I walk down, I see consumerism. I see what gentrification does to a community. I also see generations of people trying to survive with the increasing rent increases. How do you think gentrification has impacted you? How has it impacted your loved ones?
  </p>
    The seventh stop is 125th and Consumerism (W 125th Street). To continue to the next stop on the tour, locate Asthma Central (W 123rd between Adam Clayton Powell and Malcolm X Blvd.) on this Google map or this printable PDF map.

    Asthma Central (W 123rd between Adam Clayton Powell and Malcolm X Blvd.)
  </h4>
  <h5>Transcript</h5>
  <p>
    Central Harlem has the largest rate of asthma in adults. A study found that air pollution was correlated with asthma in children. Air pollution is usually the result of air pollutants due to environmental racism, industrialization etc. These are grave health impacts due to climate impacts. I often think about what these types of health impacts do to people. As an asthma sufferer myself, I carry my inhaler everywhere I go.  What other health impacts are Harlemites dealing with? What would climate justice look like in this area?
  </p>
  <p>
    The eighth stop is Asthma Central (W 123rd between Adam Clayton Powell and Malcolm X Blvd.). To continue to the next stop on the tour, locate East Harlem (W 116th and the surrounding areas) on this Google map or this printable PDF map.

    East Harlem (W 116th and the surrounding areas)
  </h4>
  <h5>Transcript</h5>
  <p>
    At the end of our tour is East Harlem, also known as El Barrio. This neighborhood is also one of the hottest areas in Harlem. Heat in New York is not distributed equally, which is often based on income, race and access to certain types of housing. Increased heat in this neighborhood leads to a number of health complications, such as vulnerability to illnesses. The high heat index further increases death in the elderly and young. What can be done to reduce heat in this community?
  </p>
  <p>
    The ninth and last stop is East Harlem (W116th and the surrounding areas). This is the end of the walking tour, feel free to explore other parts of Harlem.
