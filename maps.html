    The maps section that will be pulled from the datasets are currently not ready. I will write up these sections as I have the final products. It looks like there will be approximately 6-8 maps. Below I will list out the maps I am currently thinking about:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2016/06/06/air-quality-pollution-new-york-city/">Air quality</a>: This map will show the air quality in Harlem. This will be laid on top of maps of where communities have been redlined and public housing to show the effects.</li>
    <li>Road pollution: This will show pollution from the major highways and roads in Harlem </li>
    <li>Flooding: This will show the history of flooding in the Harlem as well as projections into the future</li>
    <li>Heat impacts: This will show the relative tree canopy in Harlem along with the heat of the surface level in Harlem </li>
    <li>Waste pollution: This will show the relative amount of waste in Harlem and how that related to the other climate issues. </li>
    <li>Health impacts: This will show how the health impacts of Harlem based on climate impacts and redlining and structural racism </li>
  </ul>
